    "url": "https://infrastructureas.ai/",
    "text": "Imagine you have to make a little change in all your microservices, like changing a line in Dockerfile, but you have 50 microservices, ouch right! The PRs, pipelines, reviews...\nI have created a dashboard with a chatbot where you can simply ask &quot;Update all repositories with alpine base image version X to Y&quot;, and then click next a bunch of time and see a list of PRs with their pipeline status.<p>Hi friends\nI&#x27;m Daniel, the creator of Infra as AI. I was laidoff from my SRE role a couple of months ago, and decided to build something that could always help me at work.\nMy job was to keep the lights on; For example: Make sure the pipelines are consistant across the org, but this was hard, I had to open each repo, make a little change, and make a PR with all the enterprise seremonies that comes after, and then I had to do this for many repos and many teams; It was hard, I could not remember which team owns what.\nAlso, sometimes the pipelines fail cuz some repo had a deprecated function, so I had to read the changelogs; And I would know it fails after opening 200 tabs of CI files.<p>At work I solved this the Kernel does, patchs. Our workaround was to generate that change in one repo, create patch files, and then `git apply` on each repo using workflows. Now with the help of HR, I got time to hackaround something I always needed. I just ask for a change, and then let the agent read the docs, find out the deprecation, make those PRs, and show me a list of them with their pipeline status next to it.<p>## Under the hood\nUsers need to index their repositories after installing our GitHub application. Indexing a repository means we pass the repo to an AI, extract important characteristics of it, and then save it for feature queries.\nWhen a user asks a query, we use LLM to figure out which are the affected repositories, and run Claude Code in those after cloning; This is followed with PRs filled with details ready to be created.<p>## Tech\nLangGraph: The agent is built on top of it\nGPT5: Finds relevant repositories\nSonnet: Your coding agent\npinecone: Holds repositories vectors\ncontext7: Getting docs<p>TL;DR: I created a platform where you can run a query against all your codebase, and create massive amount of PRs to make simple changes in your microservices. Please have a look and let me know your feedbacks &lt;3<p>PS: I&#x27;m giving away trials with 2 euros credits so you can index and query your repositories, but please watch for my pocket too ^^",

Why hadn’t I built that app, finished that novel, or launched that YouTube idea?<p>Recently I tried something simple, I think I might have read this in a book somewhere: I dumped every “someday” idea onto paper.<p>Then I split them:<p>Still excited about it = keep<p>Not anymore = trash<p>From the keep pile, I broke each dream into the tiniest first step, then scheduled it into my actual week.<p>The result? I’ve made some progress, but more importantly, I feel lighter. No more carrying the guilt of dozens of unfinished projects in my head.<p>So I’m curious:<p>What&#x27;s the primary thing that stops you from starting?  \nAnd what’s been the most effective way you’ve found to actually start?",
